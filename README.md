# Ice Builder for Visual Studio

Ice Builder for Visual Studio is a Visual Studio extension that configures [Ice Builder for MSBuild](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice-builder-msbuild) for your C++ and C# projects, all within the Visual Studio IDE. It serves as a front-end for Ice Builder for MSBuild: all the build-time processing is performed by Ice Builder for MSBuild.

Ice Builder for Visual Studio is compatible with Visual Studio 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017, and works best with the following Ice installations:
 * Ice NuGet package for Ice 3.7 or greater
 * Ice Web installation or MSI installation for Ice 3.6

## Installation

The latest version of Ice Builder is published in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZeroCInc.IceBuilder).

You can also install older versions or preview releases of Ice Builder by downloading the desired `IceBuilder.vsix` from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice-builder-visualstudio/releases), and then double-clicking on `IceBuilder.vsix`.

## Overview

Ice Builder for MSBuild provides support for compiling Slice source files (`.ice` files) within C++ and C# MSBuild projects, including projects created by Visual Studio. It compiles these Slice files using the Slice to C++ compiler (`slice2cpp`) or the Slice to C# compiler (`slice2cs`) provided by your Ice installation.

You tell Ice Builder for MSBuild which Slice files to compile by adding these files to your project, as described in the sections below. Ice Builder checks whether Slice files need to be compiled or recompiled each time Visual Studio loads a project, and each time you build a project. And if you remove or rename a Slice file with the Visual Studio IDE, Ice Builder for Visual Studio automatically removes the corresponding generated files.

## Ice Builder Options

You can configure the Ice Builder global options on the `Tools` > `Options` > `Project and Solutions` > `Ice Builder` page.

### Compile on Save Configuration

If the `Compile Slice files immediately after save` box is checked, Ice Builder compiles a Slice file when you save it, otherwise it compiles Slice files only during project builds.

### Ice Home Configuration (Ice 3.6)

With Ice 3.6, you need to specify the Ice installation used by Ice Builder. This Ice Home setting is ignored by projects that install Ice as a NuGet package.

## C++ Usage

### Adding Slice Files to a C++ Project

Follow these steps:

1. Add the Ice Builder NuGet package (`zeroc.icebuilder.msbuild`) to your C++ project.

   Adding Ice Builder creates a `Slice Files` filter in your project.

2. Add one or more Slice (`.ice`) files to your project. While these Slice files can be anywhere, you may want to select a customary location such as the project's home directory or a sub-directory named `slice`.

3. Review the Ice Builder configuration of your project, as described in the section below.

### Ice Builder Configuration for a C++ Project

Ice Builder adds an `Ice Builder` property page to the `Common Properties` of your C++ project:

These properties are the same for all configurations and platforms, and allow you to specify the options passed to `slice2cpp` when compiling the project's Slice files.

| Property                                | Corresponding MSBuild Property               |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Output Directory                        | SliceCompileOutputDir                        |
| Header Output Directory                 | SliceCompileHeaderOutputDir                  |
| Include Directories                     | SliceCompileIncludeDirectories               |
| Base Directory For Generated #include   | SliceCompileBaseDirectoryForGeneratedInclude |
| Generated Header Extension              | SliceCompileHeaderExt                        |
| Generated Source Extension              | SliceCompileSourceExt                        |
| Additional Options                      | SliceCompileAdditionalOptions                |

See [Customizing the Slice to C++ Compilation](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice-builder-msbuild/blob/master/README.md#customizing-the-slice-to-c-compilation) for a detailed description of these properties.

## C# Usage

### Adding Slice Files to a C# Project

Follow these steps:

1. Add the Ice Builder NuGet package (`zeroc.icebuilder.msbuild`) to your C# project.

   Adding Ice Builder creates a `Slice Files` filter in your project.

2. Reload your project if it targets .NET Framework.

3. Add one or more Slice (`.ice`) files to your project. While these Slice files can be anywhere, you may want to select a customary location such as the project's home directory or a sub-directory named `slice`.

4. Review the Ice Builder configuration of your project, as described in the section below.

### Ice Builder Configuration for a C# Project

Ice Builder adds an `Ice Builder` tab to the properties of your C# project:

![Missing csharp property page](/Screenshots/csharp-property-page.png)

These properties are the same for all configurations and platforms, and allow you to specify the options passed to `slice2cs` when compiling the project's Slice files.

| Property                                |  Corresponding MSBuild Property |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------|
| Output directory                        | SliceCompileOutputDir           |
| Include directories                     | SliceCompileIncludeDirectories  |
| Additional options                      | SliceCompileAdditionalOptions   |

See [Customizing the Slice to C# Compilation](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice-builder-msbuild/blob/master/README.md#customizing-the-slice-to-c-compilation-1) for a detailed description of these properties.

## Migration from the Ice Add-in

Ice Builder no longer supports direct migration from the old Ice add-in for Visual Studio to Ice Builder. The migration from the Ice add-in to Ice Builder is now a two-step process:
 * Install [Ice Builder 4.3.9](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice-builder-visualstudio/releases/tag/v4.3.9) to migrate your projects to the Ice Builder 4.3.9 format
 * Install the latest Ice Builder to convert your projects (that are now using Ice Builder 4.3.9) to the latest Ice Builder format 

## Building Ice Builder from Source

### Build Requirements

You need Visual Studio 2017

**AND**

to install ALL of the following Visual Studio SDKs:
- [Visual Studio 2012 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30668)
- [Visual Studio 2013 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40758)
- [Visual Studio 2015 SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb166441.aspx)
- [Visual Studio 2017 SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/installing-the-visual-studio-sdk)

### Build Instructions

Open the `IceBuilder.sln` solution file in Visual Studio 2017.

After building the Ice Builder extension, the VSIX package will be placed in the build output directory:
`IceBuilder\bin\Debug\IceBuilder.vsix` for debug builds, and `IceBuilder\bin\Release\IceBuilder.vsix`
for release builds.

You can sign your extension with Authenticode by setting the environment variable `SIGN_CERTIFICATE` to
the path of your PFX certificate store, and the `SIGN_PASSWORD` environment variable to the password
used by your certificate store.
